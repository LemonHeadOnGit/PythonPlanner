#   Version 0.1.2 Patch notes.

#   ALOT OF CHANGES!
   -- *Alot of progress made with easier configuration that doesn't require digging into code.*
   -- *You can now view your day in two different ways!, Normal view and Clear view, Clear view is still not   polished. So expect more changes coming into either 0.1.3 or 0.2.*
   -- *New file, config.txt, basically the ground work for better user experience.*
   -- *It also now shows you if BetterTimetable is not configured and bugs you to change the code yourself.*
   *General formatting changes.*

#   What's next in 0.2

   -- *A bit less work will be done as I research PyPi and learn how to implement GUI.. and just learn how to actually use python.*
   -- *Which means being able to configure the timetable from the terminal and not the code may come as soon as next week considering we might be skipping 0.1.3 and just adding it into a cumalative 0.2.*
   -- *And finally, it's going to take about 2 weeks at the maximum, but if it's released before that I wouldn't be surprised*
