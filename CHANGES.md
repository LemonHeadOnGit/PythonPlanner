#   Version 0.1.2 Patch notes.

#   ALOT OF CHANGES!
#   Alot of progress made with easier configuration that doesn't require digging into code.
#   You can now view your day in two different ways!, Normal view and Clear view, Clear view is still not polished. So expect more changes coming into either 0.1.3 or 0.2.
#   New file, config.txt, basically the ground work for better user experience.
#   It also now shows you if BetterTimetable is not configured and bugs you to change the code yourself.
#   General formatting changes.
