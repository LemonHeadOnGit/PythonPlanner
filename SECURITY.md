# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Considering this is a pretty small program, I doubt that theres any vulnerabilities. If there are though, I'll only sort out Security issues that can be replicated on the current release or previous.

| Version | Supported          |

| 0.2     | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.1     | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Leave an Issue with a bug tag. If it's severe though, wait for me to add a contact to this page in the case I need to work privately on it.
