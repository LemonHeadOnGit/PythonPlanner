# BetterTimetable
A simple Python program that helps you track your timetable. Initially this was just a small idea I had, but I've decided to scale it up a bit adding new features over the course of time. At it's current state it's extremely basic, and doesn't even track things, yet.
# A better way to track your timetable.
BetterTimetable is made with the goal of tracking the things you do throughout the day, timetable or just a daily schedule. While it was made with timetables in mind, a future to include just tracking hobbies, exercise and pretty much anything you gotta keep track of.
# Version 0.2 close to release.
THE BIGGEST UPDATE of BetterTimetable yet! Clear View, the setup process and alot of user experience improvements, BetterTimetable is getting... *Better*
# Updated alot (kinda).
There's alot missing, so there's alot to add! Although not daily, BetterTimetable is being updated on that constant basis teo make sure that **eventually** it's more convenient to use than pulling your timetable.
# Very Early in Development
Bugs and a *severe* lack of features should be expected.
