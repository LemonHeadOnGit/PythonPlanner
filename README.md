## What is PythonPlanner

**PythonPlanner** is a redo of a friends' python project, _BetterTimeTable_. This redo aims to improve on some programming concepts as well as implement some more features. I understand that the original wasn't even finished, but still :). Also, the original was more of an actual school timetable rather than a planner.

## What features are going to be included in this redo?

(AS OF WRITING) I aim to include some time modules for better time management, as well as a proper config file. What I also aim to do is allow functionality to switch between the timetable mode, and the planner mode.
