# BetterTimetable
A simple Python program that helps you track your timetable. Initially this was just a small idea I had, but I've decided to scale it up a bit adding new features over the course of time. At it's current state it's extremely basic, and doesn't even track things, yet.
# Version 0.1
The foundation for future updates and changes for BetterTimetable.
# Updated (about) every day
There's alot to add and BetterTimetable will continously be updated. With no GUI and it being run in a terminal, it's.. very unfinished.
# Very Early in Development
Bugs and a *severe* lack of features should be expected.
